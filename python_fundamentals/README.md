# Python Fundamentals

## Variables

Values can be assigned to objects called variables.

In Python the syntax to set a variable is:

`test = 5`

This stores the number 5 inside the variable called 'test'

You can then perform methods on variables which can perform actions on them or tell you more about the variable. As an example we can see the type of data structure/type which is stored in the 'test' variable by executing the following.

`print(type(test))`

This will return: `<class 'int'>`

This tells us that this has the integer data type.

You can store any data type or data structure inside of a variable.
