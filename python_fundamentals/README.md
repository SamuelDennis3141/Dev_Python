# Python Fundamentals

## Variables

Values can be assigned to objects called variables.

In Python the syntax to set a variable is:

`test = 5`

This stores the number 5 inside the variable called 'test'

You can then perform methods on variables which can perform actions on them or tell you more about the variable. As an example we can see the type of data structure/type which is stored in the 'test' variable by executing the following.

`print(type(test))`

This will return: `<class 'int'>`

This tells us that this has the integer data type.

You can store any data type or data structure inside of a variable.

## Data Types

## Operators

There are two types of operators arithmetic operators and comparison operators.

### Arithmetic Operators:

- `+` add
- `-` subtract
- `/` divide
- `*` multiply
- `**` exponent
- `%` returns remainder

#### Examples

```python
print(5 + 4)  # returns 9
print(5 - 4)  # returns 1
print(5 / 4)  # returns 1.25
print(5 * 4)  # returns 20
print(5 ** 4)  # returns 625
print(9 % 4)  # returns 1 (because 9/4 is equal to 2 remainder 1 and it gives the remainder)
```

### Comparison Operators:

These operators return boolean values aka True or False when comparing two operands.

- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `==` equal to
- `!=` not equal to
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `>=` greater than or equal to

#### Examples

```python
print(5 > 4)  # returns True
print(5 < 4)  # returns False
print(5 == 4)  # returns False
print(5 != 4)  # returns True
```
